-------------------------------------------------------

-- Answer: 
-- (a) 1 + (2 * 3)
-- The reducible expressions are:
--      # The entire expression, which is outermost;
--      # `2 * 3`, which is innermost.
--
-- (b) (1 + 2) * (2 + 3)
-- The reducible expressions are:
--      # The entire expression, which is outermost;
--      # `1 + 2` and `2 + 3`, which are innermost.
--
-- (c) fst (1 + 2, 2 + 3)
-- The reducible expressions are:
--      # The entire exprsesion, which is outermost;
--      # `1 + 2` and `2 + 3`, which are innermost.
-- I believe that (1 + 2, 2 + 3) is an expression, but not reducible. Even
-- though it can be seen as the tuple constructor applied to its two
-- components, it can't be further "reduced" by performing the application; in
-- a sense it is already evaluated.
--
-- (d) (\x -> 1 + x) (2 * 3)
-- The reducible expressions are:
--      # The entire expression, which is outermost;
--      # `2 * 3`, which is innermost.
